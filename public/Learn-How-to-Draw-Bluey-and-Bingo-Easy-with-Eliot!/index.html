You’ve probably seen a lot of great woodworking projects online and in magazines, and you’re itching to try one out yourself. But where do you start? What are the basic steps involved in any woodworking project?</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we’re here to help. Below, we’ve collected step-by-step instructions from some of the most experienced woodworkers in the business. Follow their advice, and before you know it you’ll be well on your way to creating your own beautiful woodworking projects!</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the right project. Not every woodworking project is suited for beginners. Make sure you select a project that is manageable, yet challenging. Something like a simple coffee table or bookcase is ideal for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gather your tools and materials. Once you’ve chosen your project, it’s time to gather up all of the tools and materials you’ll need to complete it. This can be a daunting task, but don’t worry - we have a comprehensive list of everything you’ll need on our website.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read through the entire project before beginning. This may seem like common sense, but it’s important that you take the time to read through the entire project before getting started. This will give you a good idea of what steps are involved and what materials are required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch some helpful tutorials first. If this is your first time working with wood, it might be helpful to watch some tutorials first. Our team has put together a series of helpful video tutorials that cover everything from basic techniques to more advanced projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start by cutting your pieces to size. Once you have all of your materials gathered, it’s time to start cutting them to size. Be precise when measuring and marking your pieces - mistakes made at this point can be difficult (if not impossible) to fix later on in the process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.”Butt” joints are a common way to join two pieces of wood together at right angles. One of the most basic joints in woodworking is the “butt” joint, which is used to join two pieces of wood together at right angles (see image below). You can use a variety of methods to create a butt joint - screws, nails or glue are all popular choices - but we recommend using glue for the strongest bond possible .</p>
<pre><code> 7.&quot;Miter&quot; joints allow for angled cuts across the face of boards for a neater appearance . A &quot;miter&quot; joint allows for angled cuts across the face of boards , resulting in a neater appearance (see image below). This type of joint can be created using a miter saw , mitering jigsaw or even just by hand with a sharp chisel .
</code></pre>
<p>  8.”Tongue and groove” joints are commonly used in flooring and paneling applications . Another popular joint style is the “tongue and groove” joint (see image below), which is commonly used in flooring and paneling applications . The tongue &amp; groove joint is created by cutting matching grooves into both edges of two boards , then mating them together so that the tongue on one board fits snugly into the groove on the other .</p>

But don’t worry if you’re in the latter category, because with some practice and these easy tips, you’ll be drawing like a pro before you know it!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by sketching out your idea. This doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just a rough outline will do. This will help you get your bearings and figure out what you want your finished product to look like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, start adding in the details. Don’t try to do everything at once, take your time and add one element at a time. This will give your picture more realism and make it look more professional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, don’t forget to add shading! Shading can really bring your picture to life and make it look more realistic. Experiment with different techniques until you find one that you like best.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Now it’s time to add some features to the character’s face. For Bluey, draw two curved lines below the eyes for eyebrows. Draw a small smile using three curved lines on his mouth. For Bingo, draw six small circles above his eyes for eyebrows. Draw a smile using three curved lines on his mouth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, colour in your character using your favourite colours! Bluey can be coloured blue or green, while Bingo can be coloured black or brown.</p>
