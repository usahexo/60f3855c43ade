#  NFL Owners An About-Face On Gambling?

After years of resisting any form of legalized gambling on NFL games, team owners are said to be reconsidering their position.

A report this week from Reuters cites "two people familiar with the matter" as saying that NFL owners met recently to discuss the possibility of putting a team in Las Vegas. While no decisions were reportedly made, the mere suggestion of moving a team to Sin City is a dramatic change in stance for the league's owners.

The NFL has long been opposed to gambling on its games, seeing it as a threat to the integrity of the sport. In 1992, then-commissioner Paul Tagliabue testified before Congress that "legalized sports betting threatens the very existence of professional football."

More recently, the NFL has tried to distance itself from fantasy football, which has become wildly popular in recent years. The league even went so far as to sue one of its leading fantasy football providers, DraftKings, earlier this year.

But with billions of dollars at stake, it's clear that NFL owners are starting to warm up to gambling. A recent study by Eilers Research projected that legalized gambling on NFL games could generate as much as $25 billion in annual revenue.

For team owners, that's hard to resist. And with Nevada already having approved a stadium project that would house an NFL team, it's clear that Las Vegas is ready and willing to welcome the league with open arms.

So what does this mean for the future of the NFL? It's hard to say for sure, but it seems likely that we'll see more and more teams moving into stadiums funded by casinos and other forms of legalized gambling.
Billionaires usually don't change their spots and suddenly start caring about people who have little money unless it greatly affects their pocketbook……..And THAT my friends is why NFL owners have done a complete 180 degree turnabout on their stance against legalized gambling! It's all about the Benjamins baby! And there is nothing wrong with that! Gambling has been part of our society since horse racing was created centuries ago….and now it is just evolving into different forms like online gaming and Fantasy Football (which I LOVE). So while some will try and moralize about how its wrong to gamble…..I say Live and Let Gamble! What do you think?

#  NFL Owners Eye Vegas Casino Venture

As the NFL season winds down and thoughts inevitably turn to the offseason, several NFL team owners are eyeing a potential new venture: investing in a Vegas casino.

The move would be in line with the NFL’s desire to grow its brand internationally; it has aggressively pursued ventures in London and Mexico City in recent years. And with the NFL’s popularity booming in China, it’s no surprise that some team owners are looking for new opportunities to increase revenue.

Forbes recently estimated that each of the NFL’s 32 teams is now worth an average of $2.5 billion, so there’s certainly plenty of wealth to go around. Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is reportedly interested in partnering with one or more team owners, and he already has a foothold in Vegas gaming thanks to his ownership stake in the Sands Corporation.

Any investment by NFL owners in a Vegas casino would need to be approved by the league’s other owners, and it’s not clear yet whether there would be enough support for such a move. There are certainly some potential pitfalls associated with owning a casino, including concerns about the possibility of gambling addiction and its links to organized crime.

But with NFL revenues continuing to grow, it may only be a matter of time before some team owners decide to jump into the casino business.

#  NFL Reverses Course, Considers Las Vegas Casino

After initially indicating they would not consider a casino franchise in Las Vegas, the NFL has reversed their position and is now considering the possibility.

The NFL's announcement comes as a bit of a surprise, as the league has been adamant in its opposition to gambling in the past. The move could be an indication that the NFL is changing its stance on gambling, or that it is looking to capitalize on the potential revenue generated by a Las Vegas casino franchise.

Whatever the reason, it marks a significant shift for the NFL, and one that is sure to generate plenty of debate among fans and officials alike.

#  NFL Considers Letting Casinos Own Teams

The NFL is considering a proposal that would let casinos own teams.

The proposal, which is being championed by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, would allow casinos to own up to 33% of an NFL team.

If the proposal is approved, it would likely have a major impact on the Las Vegas market, where there are already several casinos that are interested in owning a team.

Many experts believe that the proposal has a good chance of being approved, given that the NFL is looking for ways to expand its brand and grow its audience.

There is no word yet on when a decision will be made, but the NFL's annual meeting will take place in March, and the issue is sure to be discussed at that time.

# After Recent Ruling, NFL Considers Allowing Casino Ownership

The NFL is considering a new rule that would allow casino ownership, NBC Sports reported on Thursday. The vote is expected to take place at the league’s annual meeting, which begins on Sunday in Phoenix.

Commissioner Roger Goodell said the change is being considered in light of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling to repeal the federal ban on sports betting.

“We think that it’s important to make sure that we have all of the best ideas on how we can make sure that our fans have a great experience, including access to legalized sports betting, if they choose to do so,” Goodell said.

Goodell added that the NFL does not want “an uneven playing field” with other leagues that may also offer gambling options.

The Oakland Raiders are expected to be the team most affected by the proposed rule change. The team’s new stadium in Las Vegas is set to open in 2020 and will be home to both the Raiders and the Las Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL.
