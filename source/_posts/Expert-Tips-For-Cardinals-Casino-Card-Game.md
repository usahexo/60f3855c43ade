#  Winning Strategies For Playing Cardinals Casino Card Game

St. Louis Cardinals casino card game is a fun and easy game to learn. There are only three things you need to remember in order to become a winning player: know what the point value of each card is, know when to take cards, and know when to stop.

First, let’s take a look at the point values of each card. The point values are as follows:

Ace=1
2=2
3=3
4=4
5=5
6=6
7=7
8=8
9=9
10=10 Jack=11 Queen=12 King=13























  As you can see, the point values of the cards increase as the number on the card increases. In addition, two cards of the same number (e.g., two 6s) are worth 10 points each. Lastly, an Ace can be used as either 1 or 11 points, depending on what would give you the best hand. Now that you know the point values of each card, let’s move on to taking cards and stopping rules.  rule is pretty simple: if your hand totals 11 or less, you “take” another card by hitting; if your hand totals 12 or more, you “stand” (this means you do not take any additional cards). Here’s an example: if you have a 4 and a 5 in your hand (point value of 9), and the dealer has an Ace up, you would hit because your total hand value is less than 11 (you would want another card to try and make a better hand - such as a 6 for a total of 15). On the other hand, if you have a 7 and an 8 in your hand (point value of 15), and the dealer has an Ace up, you would stand because your total hand value is already 15 which is higher than 11. Lastly, let’s take a look at when to stop playing . The basic rule is to keep playing until your final hand either beats the dealer's hands or ties with it. However, there are some exceptions to this rule which we will go over now.  First , if your first two cards add up to 21 (e.g., an Ace and a 10), you immediately win regardless of what the dealer has. Second , if your first two cards add up to 17 or more (not counting an Ace as 1), then you should automatically stand regardless of what the dealer has showing. Third , if you have four cards to a royal flush (e.g., 10-J-Q-K-A), you automatically win regardless of what the dealer has showing. Lastly , if you go over 21 ("bust"), then you automatically lose even if the dealer also busts . Now that we have gone over all these rules, let's put them all together into one example game . Say that player A has an Ace and a 2 (point value of 3) while player B has a 5 and an 8 (point value of 13). The dealer has a 3 showing. Player A would hit because their total hand value is less than 11 (the dealer also has less than 11 with their 3 showing). Player B would stand because their total hand value is already 13 which is higher than 11. Finally, player A would draw one more card since their total hand value is still below 21; player B would not draw any more cards since their total hand value is already 21 or more. The end result would be that player A would have 4 points (Ace+2+3+4 = 10) while player B would have 18 points (5+8+10 = 23). The dealer would still have 3 points remaining. In this particular example game, player A loses since they had fewer points than both player B and the dealer

#  Become A Cardinals Casino Card Game Master

Casino card games are a great way to have some fun and potentially make some money. But if you're like most people, you may not know how to play some of the more popular casino card games. This is where this article comes in. In it, we will teach you how to play three of the most popular casino card games: blackjack, baccarat and roulette.

Blackjack

The goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. To do this, players must first choose how many cards they want to draw (1-5). After they've drawn their cards, they must then decide whether to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn). If they go over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The player with the highest score at the end of all the hands wins the game.

Baccarat

In baccarat, players are trying to get as close to 9 as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of all the hands wins the game. There are three ways to score points in baccarat: 1) Player - The player's score is the total value of their two cards 2) Banker - The banker's score is the total value of their two cards minus 0.5 3) Tie - A tie occurs when both players have the same score. In this case, the hand is replayed with new cards.

Roulette

In roulette, players are betting on which number (1-36) or color (black or red) a ball will end up in after it's spun around a wheel. A player can place chips on one or more numbers, colors or combinations thereof. If their number comes up, they win even money on their bet(s). If someone else's number comes up, they lose their bet(s).
