#  Las Vegas Sportsbooks Pay Out $14 Million on NFL MVP Bet

The NFL MVP race is heating up and one sportsbook made a big payout on the bet.

According to ESPN, the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas had to pay out $14 million on a bet that Tom Brady would win the NFL MVP award. Brady was given 7-1 odds to win the award, but clear front-runner Matt Ryan ended up taking home the honor.

"We had a lot of money bet on Tom Brady at 7-1 to win the MVP and we had to pay out a lot of money," Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports at Westgate SuperBook, told ESPN. "It's a pretty good chunk of change."

The $14 million payout is the second largest in SuperBook history, with the largest coming when Floyd Mayweather defeated Manny Pacquiao in 2015.

Despite his loss, Brady still had an impressive year, leading the New England Patriots to their fifth Super Bowl title.

#  Australian Punter Earns Over $600,000 from NBA Title Bet

An Australian punter has cashed in on a bet that the Golden State Warriors would win this year’s NBA championship. The punter, who has chosen to remain anonymous, placed a $600,000 wager on the Warriors at 9-1 odds before the season started.

The Warriors went on to win the title with a 4-2 series win over the Cleveland Cavaliers,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) earning the anonymous punter a payout of over $6 million. This is one of the largest payouts ever seen in Australian sports betting, and it is likely that the punter will celebrate his win by spending some time in the sun Down Under.

This isn’t the first big win for this particular punter – he also won big betting on last year’s Eurovision Song Contest. In that case, he placed a $200,000 bet on Jamala to win and walked away with a cool $2 million when she pulled off an upset victory.

Australian sports betting fans have enjoyed a banner year in 2017, with several massive payouts already being handed out. In March, an Aussie punter won more than $4 million by betting on Roger Federer to win the Miami Open.

Australian bookmakers are expecting even more big bets to be placed in advance of next year’s World Cup, as soccer fans look to take advantage of favourable odds.

#  Portugal Clean Sheets in Euro 2016 Opener; Bettor Collects $225,000

Portugal’s 2-0 victory over Iceland in the Euro 2016 opener was greeted with a great deal of excitement by bettors, as well it should have been. Portugal had a 90% chance of winning according to one popular sports betting website, and they delivered with a clean sheet. That meant that anyone who bet on Portugal to win and keep a clean sheet collected $225,000 on a $10 ticket.

It looked like things might not go Portugal’s way early on when Iceland had several good chances to take an early lead, but goalkeeper Rui Patricio came up big for the hosts, making some spectacular saves. Portugal finally took the lead in the 25th minute when Nani scored from close range, and they added a second goal just before halftime when Ronaldo headed home from a corner.

Iceland did create a few chances in the second half, but Portugal’s defense held firm and they recorded their first clean sheet of the tournament. This was also the first time Ronaldo has ever scored in an opening match at a major tournament, which will surely please all of his fans.

Now that Portugal have gotten off to a winning start, they will be looking to make it two in a row when they face Austria next Wednesday. Austria are considered slight underdogs for that match, so there is potential for more big payouts if you back Portugal to win again.

#  Leicester City Win Premier League Title; British Gambler Nets over $1.2 Million

On May 2, 2016, Leicester City won the Premier League Title, shocking the world of soccer and becoming the first (and only) team in Premier League history to win the title without losing a single match. The team’s accomplishment was all the more impressive given that they were 5000-1 outsiders at the beginning of the season.

British gambler William Hill had offered odds of 5000-1 on Leicester City winning the Premier League title at the beginning of the season, and as a result, one lucky punter netted over £1.2 million (~$1.7 million) by betting on the Foxes. This is believed to be one of the largest payouts ever given by a UK bookmaker.

Leicester City’s improbable title win has generated plenty of discussion about what went wrong for their opponents and how unusual it was for a team like Leicester to emerge victorious. But it has also led to some interesting questions about sports betting and how it is regulated in different parts of the world.

In some jurisdictions, such as Nevada in the United States, sports betting is legal and tightly regulated. In others, such as Britain, sports betting is legal but not highly regulated. And in still other jurisdictions, such as India, sports betting is illegal altogether.

What are the implications of this difference in regulation? And which jurisdiction offers punters the best chance of making a big win?

One thing that is clear is that Leicester City’s victory has made many people around the world keen to place bets on sporting events. This has led to an increase in business for bookmakers, who are reporting record profits from this year’s Premier League matches.

So far, William Hill has paid out over £22 million (~$31 million) in winnings to gamblers who bet on Leicester City this season, and there are still four matches left to play. This highlights just how lucrative sports betting can be for bookmakers – and just how risky it can be for punters!
