What Kinds of Bets Can I Place on the Steelers?

Now that we’ve looked at how successful the Steelers have been at PokerStars in recent years, let’s take a closer look at some specific bets that you can place on them. The three most common types of bets in sports gambling are spreads, totals and moneylines. Below we will explain each type and show examples of how they might be used when betting on the Steelers.

Spreads: A spread is a type of wager where one team is designated as being either “the favorite” or “the underdog”. In most cases, if you bet on the favorite you will need to wager more money than if you were to bet on the underdog in order to win your desired amount; however, your chosen team must still win by more points than predicted by the spread in order for you to collect any winnings. For example, if your chosen team is favored by 4 points and they end up winning by 5 or more points, you would win your bet. Conversely, if they only won by 3 points or less then you would lose your wager even though they technically “won” the game. Here is an example of a spread wager taken from an actual game between two NFL teams:







	Pittsburgh 	7 	(-140) 	vs 	Cincinnati 	+4 	(120)



In this example, Pittsburgh is listed as 7 point favorites (-140). This means that if you want to bet that they will win outright, then you would need to wager $140 in order to win $100; conversely, if you think Cincinnati can pull off an upset then a $100 wager would net you $120 if they manage to win. Totals: A total is simply a points prediction for an entire game combined from both teams playing - no matter which side actually wins - and winning bets are paid out based on whether or not your prediction was correct. For example, if there is a total set at 47 points and both teams score 24 points combined then anybody who had placed a “over” bet would win since 24+24 = 48; likewise anyone who wagered moneylines or side bets predicting one team would beat the other by more than 24 points would also be victorious. As with spreads there are usually different payouts
