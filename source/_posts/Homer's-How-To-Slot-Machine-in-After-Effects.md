#  Homer's How-To: Slot Machine in After Effects

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a realistic looking slot machine animation in Adobe After Effects. We'll be using masking techniques, the puppet tool, and the built-in slot machine Illustrator file to create our animation.

First, let's create our basic shape. Create a new composition and drag in a black rectangle. Change the dimensions to 1080x1920 and position it in the center of the screen.

Next, we'll add our slot machine illustration. Drag the Illustrator file into the comp and resize it so that it covers most of the rectangle. We want to use this as a guide for our mask.

Now, create a new mask and draw a rough outline of the slot machine using the pen tool. Be sure to make all of the details like coins and buttons! When you're done, make sure the mask is selected and change its mode to "Luminance Matte." This will ensure that our animation only affects the black areas of the mask.

Now let's add some animation! We'll start by creating two simple keyframes for our rectangle. At frame 0, set the scale to 0% and at frame 120 set it to 1000%. This will give us a basic starting and ending point for our animation.

Next, we'll add some animating text labels. In this case, we want each letter to spin around independently from each other. To do this, we'll use masks again. Start by creating a new solid layer and naming it "Text." Set its color to white and click on OK.

Next, type out your text using center alignment. For this tutorial, I'm going to use "HOMER'S HOW-TO: SLOT MACHINE." With your text layer selected, go to Effect >3D >Extrude & Bevel. In the settings window, set Depth to 10 and give your text a nice gold material by selecting these options:

 























  Click OK when you're done.

Now create a new mask and draw around each letter using the pen tool. When you're finished, select all of your masks and change their mode to "Alpha Matte." This will ensure that only the white areas are visible when your text is animated.

With all of your masks created, it's time to add some motion! Add 3 keyframes at frame 0, 25, and 100 . For each keyframe, set thePosition X attribute to -500 , 500 , and 0 . This will cause each letter to spin in opposite directions when animated.

#  After Effects Tutorial: How to Make a Slot Machine

In this tutorial, we will be creating a slot machine animation in Adobe After Effects. We will be using the Effect & Preset Browser, masks, the CC Sphere effect, and the Displacement Map effect to create our machine.

To start off, open up Adobe After Effects and create a new composition. Set the dimensions to 1920x1080 and name it "Slot Machine."

Now we need to add some footage to our composition. I'm going to be using a free video clip of some spinning coins from dissolve.com. Drag the clip into your composition and place it in the bottom left corner. Scale it so that it takes up most of the screen.

We're going to add a mask to this clip so that only the coins are visible. To do this, select the clip in the timeline and go to Effect > Mask > Add Mask. In the Options window, set the Mode to "Shape" and make sure that both "Invert Mask" and "Detect Edges" are checked. Click OK.

You should now see a white border around your clip. This is the mask boundary. We need to reshape it so that it matches the outline of the coins. To do this, select the Mask Path tool (the second tool from the left in the toolbar) and drag out a path around each coin.

When you're done, click on the mask in the timeline and change its Feather value to about 100 pixels. This will give it a soft edge so that it doesn't look too sharp against the background.

Now let's add some motion to our slot machine. Select Layer > New > Null Object and create a new null object called "Coin Motion." Go back to your coin clip and press Ctrl/Cmd+D to duplicate it twice. Move one copy of the clip up into position above the first coin and adjust its rotation so that it spins in a clockwise direction. Move the other copy down below the first coin and adjust its rotation so that it spins in a counterclockwise direction.

Select all three coin clips and Group them together (Ctrl/Cmd+G). Thenselect Coin Motion and Group it with them (Ctrl/Cmd+G). Now when you move Coin Motion, all three coins will move with it.

To create our slot machine animation, we're going to use two effects: CC Sphere and Displacement Map . The first thing we need to do is add these effects to our Coin Motion null object.. Go to Animation > Add Expression...and enter this expression:























   "ccSphere1"."radius"*3







      It will look something like this:Now select CC Sphere1 in your Effects & Preset Browser and change its settings as follows:Radius: 200Scale: 100Position: 0,-5Displacement Map1Go back to Animation > Add Expression...and enter this expression:It will look something like this:Now select Displacement Map1 in your Effects & Preset Browser and change its settings as follows:X Offset: -100Y Offset: 0Scale: 25Now play back your animation and you should see something like this:

#  Make a Slot Machine in After Effects with Homer's Help!

Making a slot machine in After Effects is a fun and easy way to add some gambling excitement to your videos. You can use this slot machine to create videos for casino websites, or just for fun!

To get started, open up After Effects and create a new project. then import a picture of a slot machine into the project. I found this image on Pixabay:

https://pixabay.com/en/slot-machine-vector-illustration-748202/

Next, create a new composition and drag the image of the slot machine into it. We'll use this composition as our main stage for the slot machine.

Now we need to create the different parts of the slot machine. The first part is the front panel of the machine. To create this, draw a rectangle in the top left corner of the composition and make sure it is black. Then, go to Effect > 3D > extrude & bevel and apply these settings:

Depth: 5

Bevel: 1

Width: 100

Height: 100

Now we need to give this rectangle some depth. To do this, go to Effect > Stylize >Drop Shadow and apply these settings:


Blur: 10
Color: black

Opacity: 50%

After adding the drop shadow, your rectangle should look something like this:



  Now duplicate this rectangle and move it over to the right side of the composition. We'll use it as the front panel of the slot machine. To make it look more like a real front panel, we'll add a bit of perspective to it. To do this, select both rectangles and go to Effect > 3D > Perspective. Apply these settings:

Depth Bias: 0 

X Scale Factor: 15 

Y Scale Factor: 15

Now your front panel should look something like this:



  The next part we need to create is the top panel of the machine. To do this, draw another rectangle in the top right corner of the composition and make sure it is black. Then apply Effect > 3D > extrude & bevel with these settings:

Depth: -5 
Bevel: 2  Width: 100  Height: 100  Also add a Drop Shadow with these settings : Blur : 10 Color : Black Opacity : 50% After adding these effects, your top panel should look something like this : Next we need to add some buttons to our top panel .To do this , draw six circles in different places on your top panel . Then apply Effect> 3D> Extrude&Bevel with these settings Depth : -5 Bevel : 2 Width : 20 Height : 20 Also add a Drop Shadow with these settings Blur : 10 Color : Black Opacity 50% Your buttons should now look something like this : The next part we need to create arethe reels for our slot machine . To do this ,draw three circles in different places on your front panel .Then apply Effect> 3D> Extrude&Bevel with these settings Depth : -5 Bevel : 2 Width 150 Height 150 Also add a Drop Shadow with these setting Blur 10 Color Black Opacity 50% Your reels should now look something like this Next we need to add some lights o our machines .To do thi s ,draw two circles one on each side of you reels an d on each side of you r top panel .Then apply effect> Utilities> light with These setting intensity 80 color yellow position random And that's it ! Your Slot Machine is now finished ! Here's how it looks when you play it

#  Creating a Slot Machine in After Effects - Homer's Way

In this tutorial, we are going to create a slot machine in After Effects using some basic shapes and expressions. We will start by creating the basic frame of the slot machine, and then add the details layer by layer. Let's get started!

1. First, create a new composition and set the dimensions to 570x320px. This will be the frame of our slot machine.

2. Next, we need to create the three rotating wheels that make up the machine. To do this, create a new circle layer and set its dimensions to 150x150px. Then, use the Rotation tool to rotate it around its center point 90 degrees clockwise. Duplicate this layer twice and position them evenly on either side of the first wheel.

3. Now let's add some basic text to our wheel. To do this, select one of the circular layers and click on the T icon in the toolbar to add a text layer. Type "Homer's Way" into the text field and hit Enter/Return on your keyboard to commit the text. Then, use the Move tool (V) to position it in the center of the wheel. Repeat this process for each wheel.

4. Next, let's add some highlights to our slot machine wheels. To do this, select one of the circular layers and Duplicate it (Command/Ctrl+J). Change the Fill color of this duplicate layer to white and reduce its Opacity to about 50%. Then, use the Move tool (V) to reposition it above one of the other circles so it looks like a highlight. Repeat this process for each wheel.

5. Now let's add some numbers to our slot machine wheels. To do this, select one of the circular layers and click on the T icon in the toolbar to add a text layer again. Type in any number you like into the text field and hit Enter/Return on your keyboard to commit it. Then, use the Move tool (V) to position it in any location you like on top of or below your circles as desired - I've chosen 6 as my number for this tutorial:

6. Finally, we need to animate our wheels spinning around so they look like they're actually rotating! To do this, we'll use an expression slider made specifically for rotating layers around their centers called "rotateLayer". First, select all four of your circle layers and open up the Expression Editor by clicking on those little white squares next to each layer name:



























#  Learn from Homer how to make a slot machine in AE for your next project!

In this tutorial, we will create a basic slot machine animation in Adobe After Effects using the principles of animation that Homer taught us in The Simpsons. Let's get started!

1) Start by creating a new composition and naming it Slot Machine. Set the dimensions to 1920x1080 and the frame rate to 30 fps.

2) Next, add a new solid layer to the composition and name it Background. Change the color to black and set the opacity to 100%.

3) Create three more solid layers and named them Reels 1, Reels 2, and Reels 3. Change the colors of these layers to yellow, green, and blue respectively. Set the opacity of each layer to 20%.

4) Add a new text layer and name it Title. Change the font to Arial Black and set the size to 36 pt. Type Slot Machine and set the color to white. Anchor this text layer to the top of the composition.

5) Add a new text layer and name it Instructions. Change the font to Arial Black and set the size to 24 pt. Type How To Play Slot Machine And Set The Color To White. Anchor This Text Layer To The Bottom Of The Composition.

6) Select The Background Layer And Add A New Keyframe At Frame 0 And Set Its Position To 0%. Select Reels 1 And Add A New Keyframe At Frame 0 And Set Its Position To -1920%. Repeat This For Reels 2 (-800%) And Reels 3 (-400%). Your Composition Should Look Like Something Below Now:
