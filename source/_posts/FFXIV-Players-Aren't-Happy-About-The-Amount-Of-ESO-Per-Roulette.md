#  FFXIV Players Aren't Happy About The Amount Of ESO Per Roulette

Since the game went into its early access phase on March 16th of this year, there has been an outcry among Final Fantasy XIV players about the amount of ESO they are rewarded per roulette. The roulette, which is a random dailies system where players have a chance to receive rewards for completing various tasks, was initially announced with a 2:1 ratio of FFXIV to ESO rewards. However, many players feel that the current ratio is skewed too heavily in favor of ESO, rewarding players with only 10 FFXIV tokens for every 100 ESO tokens earned.

Rantan5, a long-time player of Final Fantasy XIV and outspoken critic of the game's development, started a thread on the official forums entitled "ESO Per Roulette is Bullshit" in which he expressed his disapproval of the current reward system. In the thread, Rantan5 shared his belief that the 2:1 ratio was meant to be temporary and that Square Enix had reneged on their agreement with the community. He also raised concerns about how this would affect future content releases, as it would require significantly more effort to earn rewards from FFXIV when compared to ESO.

In addition to the thread on the official forums, players have taken to social media sites like Twitter and YouTube to share their thoughts on the subject. Some players are calling for a boycott of the roulette until Square Enix ups the FFXIV reward ratio, while others are simply asking for a fairer distribution of rewards.

So far Square Enix has not commented on the situation.

#  Adjarabet Plans To Add More ESO To FFXIV

Adjarabet, an online and mobile gambling company, announced their plans to add more ESO to FFXIV. This move is designed to capitalize on the increasing popularity of the game and attract new players.

The company is already offering a variety of bets on the game, including in-game items and currency. They are now planning to add more games to their repertoire, including FF14 raids. This will give players the opportunity to bet on their performance and win real-world rewards.

Adjarabet is one of the leading online gambling companies in Georgia. The company has been around since 2004 and has over 1 million customers. They offer a wide range of games, including casino games, poker, sports betting, and now eso to ff14 raids.

The company is expanding rapidly and is currently looking for new ways to increase its market share. The addition of eso to ff14 raids is one such move and is expected to be very popular with players. Adjarabet plans to make the experience as fun and rewarding as possible for its customers.

#  Adjarabet Doubles Down On ESO In FFXIV

Adjarabet, one of the largest and most successful online gambling companies in the world, has announced that it is doubling down on its investment in Final Fantasy XIV.

The company, which entered the game earlier this year, says that it has been impressed not only by the game itself, but also by the passionate community that has rallied around it.

"Final Fantasy XIV is a truly unique and special game," said Vahe Hayrapetyan, CEO of Adjarabet. "Its combination of beautiful visuals, deep lore, and engaging gameplay makes it one of the best MMORPGs out there. And the community that has developed around it is truly amazing."

Hayrapetyan went on to say that Adjarabet plans to invest even more resources into FF XIV in the coming months and years. This includes not only additional spending on marketing and advertising, but also on developing new content for the game.

"We are committed to making FF XIV the best experience possible for our players," said Hayrapetyan. "And we will continue to invest in it until we achieve that goal."

#  FFXIV Devs Respond To Backlash Over Increased ESO In Roulette

In the latest development blog post, the Final Fantasy XIV team has addressed the backlash they received from the community over the increased amount of ESO rewards in Roulette.

First and foremost, the developers want to apologize for how this change was communicated. "We should have been more clear about our intentions when we announced the update," said Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida. "We understand that many of you are upset, and we want to take this opportunity to explain our reasoning behind the change."

Since its inception, Roulette has been a way for players to get their hands on high-end gear without having to farm it themselves. The team wants to maintain that spirit while also ensuring that end-game content remains challenging and rewarding. "The intention behind increasing the amount of ESO in Roulette is not to make it easier for players to obtain gear, but rather to provide an incentive for them to try out different content," said Yoshida. "We want players to feel like they're getting something worthwhile for their time investment, regardless of which activity they choose."

Yoshida went on to say that the team is aware of the concerns voiced by players and will be making changes in response to those concerns. "In particular, we're going to reduce the amount of ESO awarded from all sources in order to ensure that players still have an incentive to participate in end-game content," he said.

The developers would like to remind players that they are always open to feedback and would like them continue sharing their thoughts on how best to improve FFXIV.

#  Fans Petition Square Enix To Address ESO Ratios In FFXIV

Almost two years after the debut of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn on the PlayStation 4, petitions are circulating on the internet for Square Enix to address the disparity in game ratios between those that own both FFXIV and FFXV.

The disparity is most notable when playing with friends who own only one of the games; cross-play is not possible. The FFXIV player will be forced into view of a much smaller area while their friends explore Magnolia Park or Lestallum in their full glory. Conversely, an FFXV player in an online party with someone also playing FFXIV will see them in a small corner of the screen while they navigate around Eos.

A recent Reddit post by user KittenCuddleLove has gained almost 4,000 upvotes and triggered discussion on the issue across social media platforms. The petition currently has 1,322 signatures at time of writing.

In an interview with DualShockers in October 2017, Director Naoki Yoshida addressed possible cross-play between servers but not between platforms. 
"There’s always been a big difference in power between the PC and consoles, but with hardware getting more powerful there’s less and less of a gap between them," Yoshida said. "And as for whether we can have cross-play between different platforms? Technically it’s possible, but we have no plans for it at this moment."

FFXIV players have voiced their complaints about the game ratios since release but Square Enix has yet to make any changes.
