# The Basics

Goldbet Baccarat is a variation of the classic card game baccarat. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 with your two cards. There are three possible outcomes - player, banker or tie. In most cases, the banker will win - but remember, it's still important to make the best choices with your own hand so that you can come out ahead.

There are a few different ways that you can bet in Goldbet Baccarat. The simplest is simply betting on who will win - the player or the banker. You can also bet on whether there will be a tie. Another option is wagering on whether the player or banker will have a higher score - known as 'Pair'. Finally, there's also 'Perfect Pairs', which is a side bet where you can win if your first two cards form a pair (e.g two queens).

For each type of bet, there's a different pay-out table. Make sure you familiarise yourself with these before playing, so you know what you're aiming for.

#  How to Win at Goldbet Baccarat?

There are different ways of playing Goldbet Baccarat. You can either bet on the Player or Banker, or you can bet on a Tie. You can also bet on different combinations of the three outcomes.

The goal of the game is to have a hand with a value closer to nine than the other two hands. Aces are worth one point, 2s through 9s are worth face value, and a 10 or a court card (Jack, Queen, or King) is worth 10 points. If both hands have the same value, the result is called a “push” and all bets are returned to players.

The Banker hand is always played first. If the Banker has an Ace, it is counted as 1 not 11. After the first player plays their two cards, the Banker will then play one more card. If the player has two cards totaling six or more, they must hit unless the Banker already has at least a six-card total; in which case the player stands no matter what their total. In general, when you play online Baccarat you should stand on totals of six or more and hit on totals of five or less. 

When players have equal point totals (e.g., two 5s), whichever side has the higher rank card wins (Ace high for Player and King high for Banker). If both sides have the same rank card, it is a push and no one wins that round. In addition to getting paid out when they win bets, players also receive their original bet back if their chosen hand loses (i.e., Player or Banker). 

The house edge on any given Goldbet Baccarat wager varies depending on how it’s placed but generally falls between 1% and 1.5%. So if you make well-informed choices about where to place your bets, you can give yourself a good chance of coming out ahead in the long run without having to risk too much money in the process
