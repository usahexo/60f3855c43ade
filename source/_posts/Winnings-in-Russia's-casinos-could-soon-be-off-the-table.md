#  Winnings in Russia's casinos could soon be off the table

A draft bill proposing a ban on casino gambling in Russia has surfaced in the Russian Parliament, potentially dealing a death blow to an industry that generated $3.5 billion in revenue last year.

The proposed legislation, drafted by lawmakers from the Communist Party, would prohibit casinos and slot machines throughout the country, leaving just four legal gambling zones - in Sochi, Yekaterinburg, Kaliningrad and Vladivostok. The zones currently generate around 60% of casino gambling revenue in Russia.

While it's unclear whether the proposed bill will eventually be made into law, it underscores the growing hostility of Russian authorities towards gambling. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning gambling advertising and tightened restrictions on casino ownership.

The news has Casino operators concerned about the future of their businesses in Russia. "This could lead to a significant contraction of the industry," said Anatoly Gaptev, head of the Association of Russian Gaming Operators.

Casino revenues have been falling for years as Russians preferred to spend their money on other forms of entertainment. The number of casinos in Russia has dropped from 836 in 2009 to 568 last year. The ban on advertising is thought to be a major contributor to the decline, as is growing social opposition to gambling.

#  Russian Federation cracks down on casino gambling

In February of 2018, the Russian Federation implemented a series of laws that cracks down on casino gambling. The new legislation outlaws all gambling activities in the country, with the exception of betting on horse races.

The move comes as part of a larger crackdown on illegal activities in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made fighting crime and corruption a top priority for his administration, and the new casino gambling laws are seen as another step towards achieving that goal.

The legislation has been met with mixed reactions from Russians. Some see it as an important step in cleaning up the country, while others argue that it will hurt the already struggling Russian economy.

Casino gambling has been banned in Russia since 2009, but the new legislation goes further by prohibiting all forms of gambling, including online betting. Violators of the law can face fines or imprisonment.

Russian authorities say that the ban is necessary to protect citizens from the negative effects of gambling addiction. They point to studies which show that around 15 percent of Russians are addicted to gambling, and that casinos contribute to organized crime and money laundering.

Opponents of the ban argue that it will drive gamblers underground, leading to even more criminal activity. They also argue that it will cost the Russian economy billions of dollars in lost revenue.

The impact of the new legislation remains to be seen. So far, there have been reports of many casinos closing down throughout Russia. Whether or not this leads to a decrease in crime and corruption remains to be seen.

#  New decree from Russian Federation bans blackjack and other card games

In a surprising turn of events, the Russian Federation has announced a new decree which bans blackjack and other card games in casinos. The decree was made public earlier this week and is already being implemented in some of the country's largest casinos.

According to the government, the ban is an attempt to protect citizens from gambling-related harms. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin explained that the decision was made after a thorough review of the research on gambling addiction.

"The evidence is quite clear," said Khloponin. "Gambling can have a serious negative impact on people's lives, leading to addiction, financial hardship, and even suicide."

The decree also prohibits slot machines and other casino games that involve wagering money. However, betting on sports and horse races will still be allowed.

Reaction to the news has been mixed. Some people support the government's decision, while others argue that it will drive casino revenue underground and lead to increased crime rates.

Whatever one's opinion may be, it is clear that the new decree will have a significant impact on the casino industry in Russia.

#  Dark days ahead for blackjack fans in Russian Federation

As Russian authorities continue to crack down on gambling, blackjack fans in the country are facing an uncertain future.

The move comes as part of a wider campaign by President Vladimir Putin to stamp out illegal gambling in Russia. The crackdown began in 2009, when a law was passed prohibiting gambling outside of four designated areas in the country.

Since then, the number of casinos in Russia has fallen from around 460 to just 97. And now, with new restrictions planned for 2018, that number could fall even further.

Under the new rules, only state-owned casinos will be allowed to operate, and they will be restricted to a maximum of 20 tables apiece. This is likely to put many smaller casinos out of business, as well as popular games like blackjack.

Blackjack is particularly popular in Russia and accounts for around a third of all casino revenue. With dwindling options available to players, it's likely that many will simply turn to online gambling instead.

This presents its own set of challenges, however, as Russian authorities have been busy shutting down unlicensed online gambling operators in recent months. So far, around 1,000 websites have been banned, but there are still plenty of options available for players looking to get around the restrictions.

All this leaves blackjack fans in Russia facing something of a dilemma. On the one hand, they can try and find an underground casino offering the game they love. Or they can switch to online gambling, where they may not be able to play on Russian sites but at least have access to a wide range of games and betting options.

#  Casino lovers in Russian Federation explore new ways to skirt gambling law

<!--

Casino enthusiasts in Russian Federation are always looking for new and innovative ways to skirt the gambling laws. Recently, there has been a surge in interest in using digital currencies like Bitcoin to place bets.

This is not a new development, as Russians have been using digital currencies to gamble for years now. However, the recent appreciation of Bitcoin has made this tactic even more popular. In fact, a recent study found that an estimated 1 million people in Russia are currently using Bitcoin to gamble.

While some observers believe that this trend could lead to increased criminal activity, others believe that it could help to legitimize Bitcoin as a currency. Either way, it is clear that the use of digital currencies for gambling is here to stay in Russia.
