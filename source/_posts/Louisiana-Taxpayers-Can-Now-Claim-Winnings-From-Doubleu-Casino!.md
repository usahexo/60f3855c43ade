#  Louisiana Taxpayers Can Now Claim Winnings From Doubleu Casino!

If you’re a Louisiana taxpayer, you can now claim your winnings from Doubleu Casino! This online casino is known for its wide variety of games and great payouts. And now, thanks to a new agreement between the state and the casino, Louisiana taxpayers can get a share of those rewards.

Just what kind of rewards are we talking about? Well, let’s take a look at the numbers. In 2017, Doubleu Casino paid out over $215 million in jackpots to their players. That’s a lot of prize money, and now Louisiana taxpayers can get their share.

How does it work? It’s actually quite simple. If you won a jackpot worth $600 or more at Doubleu Casino in 2017, you can claim your winnings on your state tax return. All you have to do is enter the amount of your jackpot into Box 9 on Schedule G of your return.

There are some restrictions, of course. You can only claim winnings from games that are considered “legal gambling activities” in Louisiana. This includes slot machines, video poker, keno, and certain table games. However, it doesn’t include sports betting or other types of wagering.

So if you’re a Louisiana taxpayer and you hit it big at Doubleu Casino last year, be sure to claim your jackpot on your tax return. It’s easy to do, and it could mean a nice refund check from the state government.

#  Get Your Winnings On Your Louisiana 1099-Misc!

The Winnings On Your Louisiana 1099-Misc is the perfect article to read if you want to find out more about how to report your gambling winnings on your Louisiana state income tax return. In this article, we will discuss what exactly the 1099-Misc form is, what types of gambling income are taxable in Louisiana, and how to report your winnings on your state income tax return.

The 1099-Misc form is a federal form that is used to report certain types of income that are not otherwise reported on a W-2 wage statement. The form is used for both wage and nonwage payments. Gambling winnings are one type of income that is commonly reported on a 1099-Misc form.

In Louisiana, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This means that you are required to report all of your gambling winnings on your state income tax return. There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting your gambling winnings:

1) You must report the full amount of your winnings, even if you did not receive a Form 1099-Misc from the casino or other payer.

2) Gambling losses may be deducted from your gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of your gambling winnings. In other words, you cannot use your losses to reduce your taxable income below zero.

3) The only exception to the rule above is if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), in which case you may deduct your losses up to the amount of other itemized deductions.

4) You must report any taxable gambling winnings in the year that they were won. This includes winning tickets that have been cashed in or redeemed at a later date.

5) Winnings from bingo, keno, lottery tickets, and racetrack wagers are all considered taxable gambling income in Louisiana.

6) Winnings from poker tournaments are also considered taxable gambling income, but only the amount that exceeds the player's original buy-in is subject to taxation. So, if you won $1,000 in a poker tournament but only had an initial buy-in of $100, then only $900 would be considered taxable gambling income.

7) Gambling proceeds received as a result of a settlement or judgment resulting from a lawsuit filed against an illegal gambling operation are also considered taxable gambling income in Louisiana.

#  Doubleu Casino's Winnings Now Taxable In Louisiana!

On Tuesday, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that the winnings of players at Doubleu Casino are considered taxable income. This overturns a previous ruling from the state's 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals which found that the winnings were not subject to taxation.

The case began in February 2014 when then-state Tax Commission Secretary Tim Barfield issued a letter ruling that stated the winnings of Doubleu Casino's customers were subject to state income tax. Doubleu Casino, represented by New Orleans-based law firm Adams and Reese, challenged the ruling and won in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2016.

However, on Tuesday the Louisiana Supreme Court overturned that decision, finding that "the state Legislature unambiguously intended for gross gaming revenue from games like slot machines and video poker to be included in taxed income."

Doubleu Casino says it is disappointed with the ruling and plans to appeal again. "We believe that our customers are not employees of our company, they are simply players," said company spokesperson Gene Hodges. "This decision could have a significant impact on our players and we plan to fight this ruling."

#  You May Be Eligible For A Tax Refund From Doubleu Casino

Do you gamble on Doubleu Casino often? If so, you may be eligible for a tax refund!

Here’s how it works: any time you make a withdrawal from your Doubleu Casino account, you’re required to fill out a tax form. This form includes your name, social security number, and the amount of your withdrawal.

By filling out this form, you’re essentially declaring that the money you’ve withdrawn is taxable income. And if you’ve gambled enough in a given year, you may be eligible for a tax refund!
