#  Could You Be Owed Money From a Diamond Rush Game Win?

Think back to your childhood- do you remember playing the Diamond Rush board game? It was all the rage in the early 2000s, and if you were one of the lucky few who won, you may be entitled to some money!

According to ClassAction.com, the makers of Diamond Rush, Jambo Games, are facing a lawsuit for not awarding players their winnings. If you are among the class action plaintiffs, you could be owed anywhere from $5 to $200 depending on how many diamonds you collected.

The lawsuit was filed in 2016 and is still pending. Unfortunately, there is no way to find out if you are included without taking legal action yourself. However, if you do have any questions or concerns about the case, ClassAction.com offers free consultations.

So far, Jambo Games has not commented on the pending litigation.

#  Check Your Tax Withholding Status After Winning in a Diamond Rush Game 

There are a few important things you need to do after winning in a diamond rush game. The first is to check your tax withholding status.

If you have won more than $5,000 in a single game, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will consider you to be a high-earner and you may need to adjust your tax withholding status. This is to ensure that you do not owe any money when it comes time to file your taxes.

If you do need to adjust your tax withholding status, there are a few things you can do. You can ask your employer to withhold more money from each paycheck or you can make estimated tax payments throughout the year.

The second thing you need to do after winning in a diamond rush game is report your winnings on your federal income tax return. This is required regardless of how much money you won.

You will report your winnings as taxable income on line 21 of Form 1040. You will also need to report any related expenses on line 28. These expenses could include things like transportation costs, hotel costs, and meals.

It is important to keep track of all of your related expenses so that you can accurately report them on your tax return. Reporting all of your income and expenses correctly is critical if you want to avoid any penalties or interest charges from the IRS.

Winning in a diamond rush game can be exciting, but it is important to remember these two key things: check your tax withholding status and report your winnings on your federal income tax return. By doing so, you can avoid any surprises when it comes time to file your taxes.

#  Do I Have to Pay Taxes on My Winnings from Diamond Rush? 

When it comes to taxes and gambling income, there are a lot of misconceptions out there. Many people believe that gambling income is automatically taxable, but this is not always the case. In fact, depending on the type of gambling and how you earned your winnings, you may not have to pay any taxes at all!

Let's take a look at some common types of gambling income and what you need to do in order to report it correctly on your tax return.

Casino Gambling

If you gamble at a casino and win, the casino will usually report your winnings to the IRS. However, you are still responsible for reporting these winnings on your tax return. You will need to include the amount of your winnings as well as any associated gambling losses.

Lottery Winnings

If you win a lottery prize, the money is considered taxable income. You will need to report the full amount of your winnings on your tax return. However, you can deduct any related expenses such as buying tickets or traveling to claim your prize.

Horse Racing Winnings

Horse racing winnings are considered taxable income. You will need to report any amount you earn over $600 on your tax return. Any expenses related to horse racing can be deducted as itemized deductions.

Online Gambling Winnings

Gambling income that is earned online is generally taxable. This includes poker tournaments, casino games, and sports betting. You will need to report any income over $600 on your tax return. You can also deduct any related expenses such as online gambling losses or internet service fees.

#  New York State Tax Withholding on Gambling Winnings 

As a New Yorker, when you hit a big jackpot or winnings from gambling, you may be asking yourself, "What is the tax withholding on gambling winnings in New York State?" 

The good news is that there is no state income tax withholding on gambling winnings in New York. However, if you are a resident of another state and winnings from gambling in New York, you may be subject to income tax withholding by New York State. 

Keep in mind that federal income tax withholding still applies to gambling winnings, so make sure you report your winnings on your tax return. Also, if your gambling winnings are considered taxable income, you may be subject to self-employment tax. 

If you have any questions about what taxes are withheld from your gambling winnings, consult with a qualified tax professional.

#  What is My NYS Tax Obligation For Gambling Winnings?

If you've won money from gambling, you may have to pay taxes on that money. But how much you'll owe in taxes depends on the amount of your winnings and your federal and state tax brackets.

Generally, gambling income is taxable. This includes cash prizes, the fair market value (FMV) of goods or services received as a prize, and any increase in value of a gambling asset. However, there are some exceptions. Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, but not other types of income.

Here's how it works: let's say you win $1,000 from gambling. You would first subtract any losses you had from gambling that year. If your losses were $500, then your taxable income would be $500. Next, you would look up your federal and state tax brackets to find out what percentage of your income this $500 would be taxed at. Let's say your federal tax bracket is 25% and your state tax bracket is 8%. Your total tax obligation on the $500 would be $125 (0.25*$500 + 0.08*$500).

There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting gambling income:

You must report all gambling winnings as taxable income, even if you don't receive a Form W-2G from the casino or other institution where you won money.

You don't need to include the amount of your winnings in Box 1 of Form 1040; rather, report the total amount of your winnings on Line 21 of Form 1040.

If you have multiple sources of gambling income, you should aggregate them all and report the total on Line 21.

You can only use losses from one type of gambling to offset income from that same type of gambling. For example, if you lose money playing blackjack, those losses can't be used to offset wins from poker tournaments.

Gambling losses are reported in Schedule A as Other Miscellaneous Deductions. You can deduct up to the amount of your total winnings (less any amounts already taxed), but they can't be claimed if you didn't itemize deductions on your return.
