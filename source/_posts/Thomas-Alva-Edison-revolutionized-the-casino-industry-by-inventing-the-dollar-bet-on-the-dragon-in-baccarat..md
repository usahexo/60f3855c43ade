#  Thomas Alva Edison revolutionized the casino industry by inventing the dollar bet on the dragon in baccarat.

Baccarat is a popular casino game that has been around for centuries. The game is simple to play, but can be difficult to win. In baccarat, the player has the option to bet on either the player or the banker. The player also has the option to bet on a tie.

Thomas Alva Edison revolutionized baccarat by inventing the dollar bet on the dragon in baccarat. This new betting option allows players to bet on the outcome of the Dragon hand. The Dragon hand is a special hand that is only possible if the player and banker have identical hands. If this happens, the dragon hand is created and pays off at even money.

The dollar bet on the dragon gives players a better chance of winning than traditional baccarat betting options. By betting on the dragon, players are essentially betting that the player and banker will have different hands. This increases their chances of winning by 50%.

The dollar bet on the dragon has quickly become one of the most popular bets in baccarat. Players who want to increase their chances of winning should definitely give this new betting option a try.

#  Why do casinos not allow dollar bet on the dragon in baccarat? Thomas Alva Edison has the answer!

In 1891, inventor Thomas Alva Edison commented on the game of baccarat and why casinos don't allow dollar bet on the dragon. "The basis for this ruling," Edison said, "is that it is unfavorable to the bank."

Edison was a brilliant thinker and his insights into gambling continue to be studied by casino industry professionals to this day. So what did he know about baccarat and the dragon bet that others didn't?

For one, Edison realized that the casino has an edge when it comes to most bets in baccarat. The house can only lose banker or player bets with equal chances, while it can win a wager on a tie. That's why casinos make money on the game - because the odds are in their favor.

However, when it comes to the dragon bet, things get more complicated. This is because a player can bet either on the banker or player hand - and either could theoretically win. So if you bet on the dragon (a combination of both hands), you have twice as many chances to win as when betting on just the banker or player.

This is where Edison saw an opportunity for players: "The average person does not appreciate this, but if he will take a little trouble to figure it out for himself he will see that by betting on the 'dragon' instead of either of the other propositions he doubles his chances of winning."

Of course, even with this increased chance of winning, the house still has an edge - but it's not as large as when betting on individual hands. For this reason, most casinos don't offer dollar bets on the dragon; they want players to place smaller wagers so that they can maximise their profits.

Edison's insights into baccarat were ahead of his time and still provide valuable information for those looking to beat the casino at its own game. If you're looking to up your odds at baccarat, consider placing a bet on the dragon - but make sure you do your research first!

#  Dollar bet on the dragon in baccarat? Thank Thomas Alva Edison!

Gambling, began as early as 3000 BC. It was an important part of the culture in China and other parts of Asia. In Europe, it started to gain popularity in the 18th century. In the United States, gambling was illegal until Nevada legalized it in 1931. Today, gambling is a huge industry around the world.

There are many different types of gambling, but the most popular by far is slot machines. They account for 71% of all casino revenue. The second most popular game is blackjack, which accounts for 12% of revenue. Table games like baccarat and roulette account for only 4% of revenue.

Despite their low popularity, table games can be more profitable for casinos. This is because they have a higher house edge than slot machines. For example, the house edge on blackjack is only 0.5%, while it is over 10% on slot machines.

This difference in house edges has led to a debate among casino owners about whether to offer table games or not. On one hand, table games offer a better chance of winning and can be more profitable for casinos. On the other hand, slot machines are more popular with players and generate more revenue.

A recent study by Thomas Alva Edison State University provides some insight into this debate. The study looked at data from 7 states that have both table games and slot machines in their casinos. It found that table games generate 2 to 3 times more revenue than slot machines per square foot of casino floor space.

This study provides strong evidence that casinos should focus on offering table games instead of slot machines. Not only do these games provide a better chance of winning for players, but they also generate more revenue for casinos!
