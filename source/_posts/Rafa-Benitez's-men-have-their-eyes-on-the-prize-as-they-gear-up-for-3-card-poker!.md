#  Rafa Benitez's men have their eyes on the prize as they gear up for 3 card poker!

Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse for Newcastle United, they pulled off an impressive 3-0 away win at Southampton.

The Magpies have been on a good run of late, with wins against Watford and Southampton lifting them out of the relegation zone.

Rafa Benitez will be hoping that his side can continue their good form and secure Premier League survival.

Newcastle will be looking to take on Burnley at home in their next match. The Clarets have had a disappointing season and are currently in 14th place in the table.

Sean Dyche's side were hammered 5-0 by Liverpool in their last match, so the Magpies will be confident of picking up all three points at St James' Park.

Burnley have only managed to score 27 goals this season, so Newcastle should be able to keep them at bay.

If the Magpies can beat Burnley, they will be just two points away from safety with four matches remaining.

Benitez will be hoping to add to his impressive trophy collection this season, with Newcastle still in contention for the FA Cup and the Championship title.

#  How Newcastle United FC are preparing for 3 card poker

The new season is coming up fast for Newcastle United FC and they are making sure they are fully prepared for their opponents. Manager Rafa Benitez is a well-known 3 card poker player and he is looking to use his skills to give Newcastle an edge on the field.

3 card poker is a relatively simple game that can be played with any number of players. Each player is dealt three cards, and the aim of the game is to make the best poker hand possible. There are various different ways to play 3 card poker, but the most popular variation is called heads-up poker.

In heads-up poker, both players are competing against each other for the best hand. The player with the best hand wins the pot, and the first player to reach nine points wins the game. Points are scored as follows:

One point for any combination of three cards that scores at least one point (e.g. a pair, two suited cards, etc.)

Two points for any combination of three cards that scores six points or more (e.g. three of a kind, straight flush, etc.)

Three points for any combination of three cards that scores nine points or more (e.g. four of a kind, royal flush, etc.)

Newcastle United FC have been practicing hard in preparation for their next match. They know that they will need to be at their best if they want to beat their opponents. Benitez has been working on various different strategies and he is confident that his team can come out on top.
